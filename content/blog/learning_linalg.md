## Linear Algebra ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ



In an effort to find something useful to do with my time, I decided to try out getting started with the [book of shaders]([The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)) so that I can do more with Manim and maybe understand how the backend works more properly (plus designing my own systems 👀?).
