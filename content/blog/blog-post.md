## First thoughts ðŸ˜…



Not many thoughts, but this is pretty neat. I finally set up a personal website ðŸ˜©



In all honesty, this took a lot longer to set up than it should have. **Pro**-**tip**: actually pay attention to error messages.



Also, figuring out how to add images was a pain in the ass too, but here we are. Here are some cool [manimations](https://docs.manim.community/) ðŸŽ¨ to show for it: 



**\#1** 

<img src="/img/cool.png" alt="cool" style="zoom:200%;" />



**#2**

```python
config.background_color = WHITE
class SampleScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        a = Axes()
        a.add_coordinates()
        a.set_color(BLACK) # workaround to make it light-mode
        gr = a.get_graph(lambda x : x**2, color = BLACK)
        self.add(a, gr)
```

<img src="/img/huh.png" alt="huh" style="zoom:200%;" />

Iâ€™m not sure how active Iâ€™ll be on here, but Iâ€™ll at least try to post some pretty images and maybe an entry every now and then. An entry might be me chronicling some learning that Iâ€™m doing, or just some random thoughts.



Maybe i can also put up some math assignments here ðŸ¤©:
$$
\pi = 3

Till next time ðŸ‘‹
