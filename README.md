# Welcome to *website*
My personal website to store cool stuff and blog at https://www.aquabeam.me

## Site structure
Theme configuration files are stored at `config/_default/`. Refer to https://jpanther.github.io/congo/ for an overview of configuration options and tweaks.

Currently relying on [`prismjs`](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting of code blocks (theme's default syntax highlighting is not very colourful).
Enabled by placing `prismjs` files into `static/cs`/`static/css` respectively
then calling them in `layouts/partials/extend-head.html`. See [this guide](https://making-it-pretty.netlify.app/posts/add-prism-hugo/) for more details.
